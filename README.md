## Task

Go to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ and make use of /posts to develop a NextJS Application.

The application need to be able to answer the following questions:

1. I would like to be able to paginate across the comments for a particular post.
2. For each post; I would like to know what are the different domains that the users are commenting from.
3. For each post; I would like to know what is longest comment, shortest comment and average comment and this is to be displayed on a bar chart.
4. For each post; I would like to show a graph showing the order of in which the comments where posted.
5. For each post; I would like to show all the comments related to that post and allow the user to perform sorting and searching in a table.
6. For each post; I would like to use different languages to show the headings. You will need to support English and Simplified Chinese.

### Guidelines

- Any visualizations should use the D3 library
- Any table should use the AG Grid library

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
